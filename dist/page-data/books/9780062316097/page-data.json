This book provided thorough and insightful answers to compelling questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where do homo sapiens come from?</li>\n<li>How did homo sapiens proliferate and dominate the world?</li>\n<li>What is the critical difference between homo sapiens and other species?</li>\n<li>How did homo sapiens migrate, and expand their habitats</li>\n<li>What was the defining point in history that created a modern, industrialized world?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The author takes us through the history of human development, through Cognitive Revolution to Agricultural Revolution. He explains why many concepts, such as religion, economics, politics and human rights were created, and how they evolved to be what we know today.</p>\n<p>Harari emphasizes the factors setting homo sapiens apart from other species, such as the ability to create imaginative concepts and work towards a unique goal as a group. While this left me with a positive feeling about many achievements attiributed to homo sapiens, Harari highlights many negative practices that homo sapiens have developed. He also touches on the future outlook of the humankind, which leads into another book written by the author, Homo Deus.</p>\n<p>The book encourages the reader to think about the future, and asks of us:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"How do we want to shape our future?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Harari makes it clear that we have the cognitive ability and power to achieve incredible things as a group. The outlook of our future depends upon how we use them.</p>\n<p>I genuinely enjoyed reading this book, and Harari's writing is illuminating, though somewhat long winded at times.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 17, 2021","slug":"/books/9780062316097","title":"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind","isbn":"9780062316097","genre":"History","rating":4}},"book":{"bookData":{"isbn":"9780062316097","volumeInfo":{"title":"Sapiens","subtitle":"A Brief History of Humankind","publisher":"Harper","publishedDate":"2015-02-10","description":"One hundred thousand years ago, at least six human species inhabited the earth. Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations, and human rights; to trust money, books, and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables, and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? In Sapiens, Professor Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical—and sometimes devastating—breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural, and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology, and economics, and incorporating full-color illustrations throughout the text, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behavior from the legacy of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come? Bold, wide-ranging, and provocative, Sapiens integrates history and science to challenge everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our heritage...and our future.","pageCount":464,"printType":"BOOK","averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":86,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=ibALnwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9780062316097&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=ibALnwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9780062316097&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Sapiens.html?hl=&id=ibALnwEACAAJ","authors":["Yuval Noah Harari"],"imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ibALnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/9780062316097","isbn":"9780062316097","genre":"History"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
