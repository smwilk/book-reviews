I have heard my family, friends and colleagues say that your 20s is when you should take on challenges and find out who you are. But I never really understood what that meant until I read this book.

This book introduces the concept of identity capital, which I now can remind myself of every time I make a decision. It's easy to think that in your 20s, because you're young, you still "have time" to spend your energy on things that don't bring impact to your life. 80% of life-changing events happen before the age of 35. This book reminded me that there is no better time than in your 20s to expose yourself to different environments, build connections, have meaningful relationships with others, to set yourself up to achieve goals you had planned in your 30s and onwards. 

I'd like to read this book again in a few years to revise my progress, and to remind myself of the weight of every decision I make.
