This was probably the first book I read in the "self-help" category. Before reading this book, through the title, I had the impression that this book would be a spiritual guide with messages filled with encouragement and cheer. I coundn't be more wrong.

This book takes a philosophical approach based on a theory developed by an Austrian medical doctor, Alfred Adler. Through the voice of a philosopher, Kishimi affirms that trauma does not exist, and all worries stem from relationships. This was thought-provoking, and hard to believe at first. Yet as I read through the content, it became increasingly convincing.

Before reading this book, I knew little about Adler and his theory. Different aspects of his theory struck a chord with me, and I had many light bulb moments. It helped me think about everyday interactions, and the conscious and subconcious incentive behind them.

I would recommend this book to someone who blames themselves after unsuccessful human interactions, feels insecure, or are constantly swayed by others' behaviour or reactions.
