Before reading this book, there were many gaps in my knowledge of the full history of humankind. This book provided thorough and insightful answers to compelling questions like:

- Where do homo sapiens come from?
- How did homo sapiens proliferate and dominate the world?
- What is the critical difference between homo sapiens and other species?
- How did homo sapiens migrate, and expand their habitats
- What was the defining point in history that created a modern, industrialized world?

The author takes us through the history of human development, through Cognitive Revolution to Agricultural Revolution. He explains why many concepts, such as religion, economics, politics and human rights were created, and how they evolved to be what we know today.

Harari emphasizes the factors setting homo sapiens apart from other species, such as the ability to create imaginative concepts and work towards a unique goal as a group. While this left me with a positive feeling about many achievements attributed to homo sapiens, Harari highlights many negative practices that homo sapiens have developed. He also touches on the future outlook of the humankind, which leads into another book written by the author, Homo Deus.

The book encourages the reader to think about the future, and asks of us:

> "How do we want to shape our future?"

Harari makes it clear that we have the cognitive ability and power to achieve incredible things as a group. The outlook of our future depends upon how we use them.

I genuinely enjoyed reading this book, and Harari's writing is illuminating, though somewhat long winded at times.
