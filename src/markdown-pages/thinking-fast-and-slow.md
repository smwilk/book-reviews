Reading this book gave me great motivation to reevaluate the way I think. This book takes a scientific and evidence-based approach to analyse the way we react to various information and scenarios, such as:

- Positivity and negativity
- Numbers and statistics
- Risks and rewards

The author divides the human cognitive system into "System 1" and "System 2", where System 1 is responsible for intuitive fast-thinking, or so-called "gut-feeling". System 2 is slow, deliberate thought, also known as "logic".

While System 1 is swift and impulsive, System 2 is lazy. It takes energy and mental load for people to think with logic.
The author emphasizes that particularly when people try out some unfamiliar mental tasks. we tend to use System 1. While System 1 can generate reasonable answers, quite often the provided answer is biased, and false. While this would not be a problem if System 2 detected the falsehoods, unfortunately, we tend to default to simply go with our intuition, and our brain doesn't have a warning system to tell us that our System 1 is unreliable. The author calls this "cognitive illusion".

Another concept that the author highlights in this book is how our brains are more focused on memory than experience. He uses an example of an experiment, where participants were asked how much they would be willing to pay for a trip overseas on a condition that they all of their memory - mental memory, photographs, videos, souvenir would be deleted after the trip. As one can easily imagine, most participants were not willing to pay as much for such a condition.

The author points out that focusing more on the experiencing self can improve one's life. There are many examples where this concept is relevant, such as minimalism and Zen.

This is a book that I would like to read over and over again. I'm sure anyone from any age group can benefit from this book.
