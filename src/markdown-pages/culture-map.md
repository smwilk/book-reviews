This is a captivating book for those who work in a multi-cultural environment. The book takes an interesting approach to analyse characteristics of people from certain cultures using a spectrum. This spectrum helped me understand that cultural differences emerge on a relative scale, where one person from a culture may possess a **stronger** characteristic than someone from another culture. The author also highlights that someone from a culture may be similar to another person on one characteristic, for example, punctuality, but can be on the opposite ends of the spectrum on another characteristic, such as the way feedback is given. 

The author provides a number of amusing anecdotes from her personal experiences, which made the reading process enjoyable. This is a book that will help business persons throughout their careers, in countless scenarios including winning a deal with someone from the opposite end of a cultural spectrum, or resolving conflicts within a team of international members.
