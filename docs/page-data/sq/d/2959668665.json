Highly recommend.” —Marc Andreessen Reading this book could change your life. The Courage to Be Disliked, already an enormous bestseller in Asia with more than 3.5 million copies sold, demonstrates how to unlock the power within yourself to be the person you truly want to be. Is happiness something you choose for yourself? The Courage to Be Disliked presents a simple and straightforward answer. Using the theories of Alfred Adler, one of the three giants of nineteenth-century psychology alongside Freud and Jung, this book follows an illuminating dialogue between a philosopher and a young man. Over the course of five conversations, the philosopher helps his student to understand how each of us is able to determine the direction of our own life, free from the shackles of past traumas and the expectations of others. Rich in wisdom, The Courage to Be Disliked will guide you through the concepts of self-forgiveness, self-care, and mind decluttering. It is a deeply liberating way of thinking, allowing you to develop the courage to change and ignore the limitations that you might be placing on yourself. This plainspoken and profoundly moving book unlocks the power within you to find lasting happiness and be the person you truly want to be. Millions have already benefited from its teachings, now you can too.","pageCount":288,"printType":"BOOK","averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":1,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=AWfuyQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9781501197277&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=AWfuyQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9781501197277&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Courage_to_Be_Disliked.html?hl=&id=AWfuyQEACAAJ"}},{"isbn":"9780062316097","volumeInfo":{"authors":["Yuval Noah Harari"],"title":"Sapiens","subtitle":"A Brief History of Humankind","publisher":"Harper","publishedDate":"2015-02-10","description":"One hundred thousand years ago, at least six human species inhabited the earth. Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations, and human rights; to trust money, books, and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables, and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? In Sapiens, Professor Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical—and sometimes devastating—breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural, and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology, and economics, and incorporating full-color illustrations throughout the text, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behavior from the legacy of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come? Bold, wide-ranging, and provocative, Sapiens integrates history and science to challenge everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our heritage...and our future.","pageCount":464,"printType":"BOOK","averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":86,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=ibALnwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9780062316097&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=ibALnwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9780062316097&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Sapiens.html?hl=&id=ibALnwEACAAJ"}}]}}}
