Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations, and human rights; to trust money, books, and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables, and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? In Sapiens, Professor Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical—and sometimes devastating—breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural, and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology, and economics, and incorporating full-color illustrations throughout the text, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behavior from the legacy of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come? Bold, wide-ranging, and provocative, Sapiens integrates history and science to challenge everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our heritage...and our future.","pageCount":464,"printType":"BOOK","averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":86,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=ibALnwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9780062316097&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=ibALnwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:9780062316097&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Sapiens.html?hl=&id=ibALnwEACAAJ","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ibALnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}}},{"isbn":"9781501197277","volumeInfo":{"authors":["Ichiro Kishimi","Fumitake Koga"],"title":"The Courage to Be Disliked","subtitle":"The Japanese Phenomenon That Shows You How to Change Your Life and Achieve Real Happiness","publisher":"Atria Books","publishedDate":"2018-05-08","description":"“Marie Kondo, but for your brain.” —HelloGiggles “Compelling from front to back.
